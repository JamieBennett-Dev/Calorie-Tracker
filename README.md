## Workflow
### Agile Methodology
For this project I adopted an Agile methodology. This is the first time I have used this on a solo project, however, I have used it as a group during three previous hackathons. This has helped me to: 
- Organise and prioritise my workflow.  This has been essential due to the very limited timeframe we had to complete this project.
- Enabled me to adjust my expectations and still produce the required MVP

I created a site map and workflow diagram:

I used Github projects to convert my user stories into actionable tasks. The acceptance criteria was very helpful to ensure all necessary tasks were completed.

## Design Choices
### Colours

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/00173d-0056e0-adcdff-3d001b-e00061-ffadd1) to generate my colour pallet:

![Screenshot](static/images/ct-colours.png)

I chose a clean and simple website design that prioritises content. Using a vibrant color scheme, I aimed to balance minimalism with boldness. The off-white background (#f1f1f1) maintains simplicity and cleanliness, while splashes of color inject visual interest against this neutral backdrop. This approach creates a modern aesthetic that is stylish yet restrained.

The combination of blue and raspberry forms a harmonious contrast, complemented by cool off-white tones, ensuring a cohesive and balanced palette. Neutral colors were selected to promote overall harmony.

The result is a thoughtfully curated color palette that enriches the design with sophistication and vibrancy while preserving its elegance.
